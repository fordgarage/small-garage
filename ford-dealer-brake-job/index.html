<p>Labor costs are estimated between $148 and $186 while parts are priced at $62. I thought this was insane. To help the vehicle slow down, these two pads push against the rotor. The 12th generation of the truck, and specifically its brake system, has had very few problems since most of the brake system was carried over from the previous platform.</p>

<p>My 2014 escape titanium was at the dealer last week to have the transmission cable bushing recall done. Brake pads were $69 for each set, not to bad, but the brake fluid charge was $82, the turning of the rotors was $120, and the rest was labor. The lowest cost is buy parts, oem or aftermarket , online and take them to a small independent garage to have it installed. For each axle, this average cost is about $110 to $250 total for a front brake job, without rotors. 1996 Ford Bronco Eddie Bauer 4x4 for sale on BaT Auctions sold for.</p>
